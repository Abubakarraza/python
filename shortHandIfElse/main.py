# Short Hand If-else

# There is also a shorthand syntax for the if-else statement that can be used when the condition being tested is simple and the code blocks to be executed are short. Here's an example:
# Example
a = 2 
b = 40

print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a==b else print("B")

c = int(input("Enter any number:"))

print("Number is Positive") if c > 0 else print("Number is less than 0 ") if c < 0 else print("Number is 0")
